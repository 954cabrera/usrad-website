                Donna's foundational work in patient-centered service shaped our
                company culture and continues to influence how we approach every
                patient interaction. Her pioneering "One Step Service"
                methodology became a blueprint for patient-centered coordination
                that still shapes how healthcare service is designed today.

              Donna Cabreraâ€™s work in medical imaging began in the early 1990s,
              when she co-founded our original imaging venture. Recognizing the
              gap between clinical excellence and patient experience, she built
              the company's Client Service Department from the ground
              upâ€”establishing protocols that put patients at ease during what
              can often be stressful medical procedures.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              A cornerstone of Donna's innovation was developing the "One Step
              Service" at AnciCare PPOâ€”a comprehensive end-to-end patient
              management system that revolutionized the imaging experience. Her
              system coordinated all stakeholders in the care journey: patients
              were scheduled within 72 hours (with immediate accommodation for
              urgent cases), while referring physicians, case managers, and
              employers received seamless communication throughout the process.
              By guaranteeing rapid report delivery and implementing quality
              assurance across every touchpoint, Donna's system achieved
              exceptional satisfaction rates while dramatically improving
              operational efficiency.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Currently serving as Patient Advocacy Advisor at USRad, Donna
              provides strategic guidance on maintaining our patient-first
              culture as we scale. Her decades of frontline experience inform
              our service design, ensuring that even as technology evolves, the
              human touch remains at the center of everything we do.
